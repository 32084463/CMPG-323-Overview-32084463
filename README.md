# The use of a gitinore file in every project 
Gitinore file is a file that will tells Github which files to commit when comming to github every project had a repository linked to it in every repository a gitinore file was included everytime there was a commit that gitinore file will track the files that should be ignored in such case

# The storage of credentials  and sensetive information
Storage of crededentials and sensitive information is very critical as we do have an option for public repositorie and projects so in this case all of the repositories and including a kanban project there were pubclic.
